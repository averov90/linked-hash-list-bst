### :small_orange_diamond: [Русская версия](/README.md)

This repository provides an implementation of several data structures listed above.

The implementation of the above structures is made quite simple, one might even say "naive". For this reason, the code presented in this repository can be used as examples in literature/courses/tutorials (with the exception of *btree.h*) for novice developers.

The file *btree.h* is a bit "apart", which contains an example of how NOT to implement a data structure. Simply put, there is an example of a trash code. This example can be useful for tasks like "find what's wrong" or something similar. It is highly discouraged to use the code given in *btree.h* in projects.

Optimizing the given structures can be a good task.
